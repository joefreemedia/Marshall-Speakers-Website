# Marshall Speakers Website
Marshall website is a small ecommerce product site to highlight 2 of Marshall's top speakers.
This is a group project that included Patryk Kolodko, Dexter Fearing, and Dennis Markham.
My key contributions to the project is the jquery functionality applied in the navigation.
- Products submenu
- Contact From Modal
- Form toggle in within modal
- Slidedown div for checkout
